--AppleScript to recursively search through the files and subfolders in a folder that the user selects, and copy these folders to a flat structure elsewhere
--Inspired by the need to capture documents on a teacher's mac created by Apple Classroom which seem to disappear after the Classroom app is quit

-- Define the source folder and the destination folder
set sourceFolder to (choose folder with prompt "Select the folder to search through:")
set destinationFolder to ((path to desktop as text) & "CopiedDocuments:")

-- Create the destination folder if it doesn't exist
tell application "Finder"
	if not (exists folder destinationFolder) then
		make new folder at desktop with properties {name:"CopiedDocuments"}
	end if
end tell

-- Function to recursively search through folders and copy documents
on searchAndCopy(sourceFolder, destinationFolder)
	tell application "Finder"
		set fileList to every file of sourceFolder
		set folderList to every folder of sourceFolder
		
		-- Copy files to the destination folder
		repeat with aFile in fileList
			duplicate aFile to destinationFolder
		end repeat
		
		-- Recursively search through subfolders
		repeat with aFolder in folderList
			set thefileList to every file of aFolder
			repeat with aFile in thefileList
				duplicate aFile to destinationFolder
			end repeat
			--searchAndCopy(aFolder, destinationFolder)
		end repeat
	end tell
end searchAndCopy

-- Call the function to start the process
searchAndCopy(sourceFolder, destinationFolder)
